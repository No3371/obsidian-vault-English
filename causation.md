Examples from literature

-   Causes.—Upon the causation of contraction a very great deal has been written, both by early veterinarians and by those of the present day. [](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Source - Harry Caulton Reeks: Diseases of the Horse's Foot") 
-   Similarly, if the word 'force' is sometimes used for convenience in analysing causation, it means nothing more than something in time and space, itself moving, or tending to move, or hindering or accelerating other things. [](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Source - Carveth Read: Logic") 
-   The causation of material changes in the liquid sphere would in fact be all that these three kinds of ether could achieve together. [](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Source - Ernst Lehrs: Man or Matter") 
-   This at once suggests two of the principal factors in their causation—namely, concussion and loss of normal function. [](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Source - Harry Caulton Reeks: Diseases of the Horse's Foot") 
-   This is a very important rule in scientific investigation, since it enables us to detect the presence of causation. [](https://www.gutenberg.org/ "Source - Carveth Read: Logic")
